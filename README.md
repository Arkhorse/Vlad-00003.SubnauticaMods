|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Canceled\MultiQMod | My attempt to remake Lilith's multimod using the QModManager. Canceled because it's already done by Qwiso here - https://github.com/Qwiso/QMultiMod |
| WaterFilterOverflow | This mod would automactily move the water and salt out of the water filtration machine to the AutoSort Lockers. Standalone version? Maybe, but later. |
| DrillableScan | Splits the large resource deposits and the regular resources in the scanner room |
